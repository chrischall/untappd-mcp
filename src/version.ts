// Single source of truth for the server version. release-please bumps the
// string below via the version marker (registered in release-please-config
// json's `extra-files`), and `versionSyncTest` guards that it stays equal to
// package.json. Import VERSION wherever the version is needed rather than
// re-declaring it.
export const VERSION = '0.0.0'; // x-release-please-version
