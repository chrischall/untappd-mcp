# untappd-mcp

An MCP server for [Untappd](https://untappd.com). It talks to Untappd's mobile
(v4) API using your own account — search beers, breweries, and venues; read
profiles, check-ins, wishlists, distinct beers, badges, friends, and your friend
activity feed; and post check-ins, toasts, and comments.

> Developed and maintained by AI (Claude Code). Use at your own discretion. This
> is an unofficial client that uses Untappd's private mobile API; it is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by Untappd.

## How it works

Untappd's iPad/iPhone app authenticates with a username/password **xauth** login
(`POST https://api.untappd.com/v4/xauth`) that returns an access token, then
calls the v4 API. This server reproduces that exactly:

- Reads carry the token as an `access_token` query param.
- Writes carry it as an `Authorization: Bearer` header (with the app's client
  credentials in the query), matching the app's real requests.

The token is fetched on demand, cached in memory, and refreshed automatically if
it goes stale.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UNTAPPD_USERNAME` | yes | Your Untappd username or login email. |
| `UNTAPPD_PASSWORD` | yes | Your Untappd password (used only for the xauth login). |
| `UNTAPPD_CLIENT_ID` | yes | The Untappd mobile app client id (see below). |
| `UNTAPPD_CLIENT_SECRET` | yes | The Untappd mobile app client secret. |
| `UNTAPPD_DEVICE_ID` | no | Stable device UUID the token is keyed to (a default is provided). |
| `UNTAPPD_UTV` | no | API version param (default `4.0.0`). |
| `UNTAPPD_USER_AGENT` | no | Override the User-Agent (default mimics the app). |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in for local use.

### Obtaining the client id / secret

Untappd does not publish these; they live in the mobile app. Capture them from
your own app's traffic with an HTTPS proxy:

1. Install a proxy such as [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) and trust its CA
   certificate on the device running the Untappd app.
2. Point the device (or, on an Apple-silicon Mac running the iPad app, the Mac's
   system HTTP/HTTPS proxy) at the proxy.
3. Open Untappd and sign in. Find the `POST https://api.untappd.com/v4/xauth`
   request — its **query string** contains `client_id` and `client_secret`.
4. Put those into `UNTAPPD_CLIENT_ID` / `UNTAPPD_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Keep these values private; do not commit them.

## Remote connector

This server can also run as a hosted Cloudflare Worker — an unlisted, shareable
"remote connector" you add to claude.ai (Settings → Connectors) instead of
running it locally. It works on Claude web, desktop, and mobile alike, since
connectors added on any of those sync to the rest. Each person you share it
with logs in with their *own* Untappd username and password; the operator only
ever supplies the shared Untappd app credentials, never anyone's personal
login. The `.mcpb` / stdio install above remains the desktop-only alternative
if you'd rather run it locally against just your own account.

Setting this up requires a Cloudflare account and is a manual, one-time
process for whoever hosts it — see
[`docs/DEPLOY-CONNECTOR.md`](docs/DEPLOY-CONNECTOR.md) for the full runbook.
